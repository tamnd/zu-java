/* libzu: C API for the zu embedded property-graph database.
 *
 * A zu_database is a path and a configuration that have been checked
 * against a real file. It holds no descriptor and no cache, so it is
 * thread-safe and shareable. A zu_conn is the state that cannot be
 * shared: a file handle, the caches, and the plans compiled against a
 * catalog. A host that queries from four threads opens one database and
 * connects four times.
 *
 * A connection may move between threads but must not be used from two
 * at once; a call that finds one already in use answers
 * ZU_MISUSE_CONCURRENT rather than corrupting a cache. Statements
 * belong to the connection they were prepared on, and using one after
 * that connection closes answers ZU_MISUSE_CLOSED rather than following
 * a dangling pointer. Results own their rows outright, so a result
 * stays readable after its connection has gone back to a pool.
 *
 * Every pointer an accessor returns (column names, column buffers, cell
 * strings) stays valid exactly until zu_result_free on the result that
 * produced it, or until zu_result_arrow, which is the one call that
 * spends a result rather than reading it and hands those same bytes to
 * an Arrow consumer. Every *_free and *_close call here is a no-op on
 * NULL.
 *
 * Every fallible call returns a zu_status and writes what it produced
 * through an out-parameter, because one returned pointer cannot say
 * both "this failed" and "this succeeded and there is nothing here".
 * The out-parameter is written on every path, NULL when there is
 * nothing to point at, so a caller who ignores the status is never
 * left holding a pointer from the call before.
 *
 * What a user reads comes back separately. The calls that can fail for
 * a reason the engine has something to say about take a zu_error ** as
 * their last parameter; on anything but ZU_OK they write a handle
 * there, which the caller reads through the zu_error_* accessors and
 * releases with zu_error_free. Passing NULL for that parameter
 * discards the error and keeps the status. The accessors below take no
 * error handle: their failures are structural, and the status names
 * each one exactly.
 *
 * Strings cross this boundary as a pointer and a length, since most
 * source languages have counted strings and a NUL-terminated parameter
 * makes every one of them copy a string that already knew how long it
 * was. Each of those calls has a _z variant for a caller who genuinely
 * has a C string. A NULL pointer with a zero length is the empty
 * string, not an error.

/* Errors. An error carries the status its call returned, the GQLSTATUS

 * retrying, where in the statement it happened, the line that place is
 * on, and the message, as fields rather than as one string to parse:
 * the code picks which exception class a binding raises, the severity
 * decides whether it raises at all, and neither survives being
 * formatted into prose and parsed back out.
 *
 * The strings live until zu_error_free, and each len out-parameter may
 * be NULL. A string a failure does not carry is NULL rather than
 * empty, since no condition and an empty condition are different
 * facts: zu_error_code, zu_error_standard_text and zu_error_doc_url
 * are all NULL for an engine-internal failure, which has no code
 * rather than one that would be a guess.
 *
 * zu_error_message is zu's own account, naming the table, the token or
 * the value. zu_error_standard_text is the standard's words for the
 * condition class and subclass, which is what a conformance harness
 * grades. zu_error_doc_url is where that condition is written up, so a
 * binding hands a reader a page rather than five characters to search
 * for.
 *
 * zu_error_retryable answers 1 when running the same statement again
 * could succeed, 0 when it could not, -1 for a NULL error. A write
 * that lost to a concurrent one is the 1: nothing of it was applied.
 * Text that will not parse is the 0, and so is a statement the caller
 * interrupted, which did not fail so much as stop. A retry loop reads
 * this rather than carrying a list of codes, which is the sort of list
 * that is right in one binding and stale in the other five.
 *
 * zu_error_position writes the line and column the condition was
 * raised at, both 1-based, the column counted in characters so a line
 * of multi-byte text does not read as wider than it looks, and
 * zu_error_offset writes the same place as a 0-based byte index into
 * the statement, for a caller that slices the text rather than
 * printing it. Both answer ZU_OK and write when there is a position,
 * ZU_DONE and write nothing when there is not, and ZU_MISUSE for a
 * NULL error. Not every failure has one: a division by zero happens
 * while the statement runs and has no token to point at, and an io
 * error has no statement at all. Every out-parameter may be NULL. The
 * offset is always on a character boundary, so slicing at it cannot
 * split a character in half.
 *
 * zu_error_excerpt is the line that position is on, without its
 * newline, which the column counts characters into: a caller has both
 * halves of a caret without having kept the statement text. It is NULL
 * when there is no position, when the line is empty, and when the line
 * is longer than anyone would read under a caret, since a line cut to
 * fit would put the column somewhere it is not.
 *
 * The message says all of this in words and keeps saying it, so
 * printing it alone is still a complete report. The fields are for the
 * caller that would rather underline the token than read the numbers
 * back out of the sentence. */

 * checks, which is a chunk of rows rather than the end of the query,
 * and answers ZU_INTERRUPTED. Nothing failed: the connection keeps its
 * plans and its warm caches and runs the next statement normally, which
 * is the difference between this and closing it.
 *
 * An ask raised while nothing is running is dropped when the next
 * statement starts, so a Ctrl-C at a prompt cannot end whatever the
 * user types next.
 *
 * zu_conn_rows_read is the same watch by polling: how many rows the

 * and ignores interval_ms; a callback with an interval of zero is
 * ZU_MISUSE, since a period of nothing is not a period. The
 * arrangement belongs to the connection and covers every statement
 * after it, and a statement already running keeps the one it started
 * with.
 *
 * The callback runs on a thread of this library's, one per statement,
 * never two at once and never after the call it belongs to has
 * returned. It is not called on the thread that asked for the

 * at the statement that wrote, not at the commit. Beginning inside a

/* Chunked reads: the same columns, a chunk of rows at a time.
 *

 * engine did not fill: on those, the whole-column call converts all of
 * the column before returning any of it and keeps the conversion until
 * the result is freed, so a million-row int column is eight megabytes
 * of buffer beyond the rows and reading the first hundred rows and
 * stopping pays for the other 999,900. A chunked read converts the
 * chunk asked for, into a buffer of a fixed size that the next chunk
 * reuses. On a column the engine did fill, both calls are pointers
 * into the buffer it wrote and neither converts anything, so the
 * choice is about the shape of the reading loop and nothing else.
 *
 * That is the trade: a chunk pointer is valid until the next call for
 * the same column and the same accessor, which may replace its
 * contents, or until zu_result_free. A host that needs one chunk to outlive the
 * next copies it, which is the copy it was making anyway on the way
 * into a host array. Columns are independent of each other, so reading
 * a chunk's values and its validity together costs no reconversion.
 *
 * zu_result_chunk_count is the loop bound, and it is 0 for a result
 * with no rows, which is why nothing here answers ZU_DONE. Ask each
 * chunk its size rather than multiplying: chunks are the same size
 * today except the last, and will stop being once a chunk is what the
 * executor produced rather than a slice of what it materialized. The
 * offset turns a chunk row back into the row number the cell accessors
 * take, which is how a string column is read beside a chunked one.

 * before anything could refuse: after this the result holds nothing to
 * read a second time. Do not call zu_result_free on it, and do not keep

 * out rather than by any function of this library. It is written only
 * on ZU_OK.
 *
 * ZU_UNSUPPORTED means the library was built without the arrow feature,
 * which is the one answer about the build rather than the call; the

 *
 * zu_result_gqlstatus is the completion condition: "00000" for a
 * statement that answered with columns, and "00001", successful
 * completion with the result omitted, for one that had none to give
 * back. It is the value the JSON Lines protocol already writes into
 * every record and the value a conformance harness grades. It is never
 * NULL for a result that is not NULL, and it belongs to the result
 * rather than to the caller, so it is good until zu_result_free and is

 * through. An exception replaces a result and arrives as an error; a
 * warning rides along with one, because a statement that dropped a null
 * out of an aggregate still has rows to give you and the standard still
 * wants you told. Almost every statement raises none, so a host that
 * asks and finds nought has paid for one call.
 *
 * A notice comes back as a zu_error, which is one shape rather than
 * two: a diagnostic record is a diagnostic record, the code, its
 * standard text, the severity, the place, the line and the doc page are
 * the same accessors either way, and a binding that already turns one
 * of these into an exception gets its warning class for the cost of
 * reading zu_error_severity. That is what tells them apart, along with
 * zu_error_status, which is ZU_OK here because that is what the call
 * that produced it returned. It is a copy rather than a borrow, so the

 *
 * The order is fixed: create, then table, then columns and edges in any

 * that passed it rather than at finish so the error names the column
 * while you still know which one you were building.
 *

 * happened or did not. The loader copies every array it is given, which
 * means a caller may free or reuse its own buffers as soon as a call
 * returns; the alternative is a lifetime rule this comment could not
 * state safely.
 *
 * A loader is used from one thread, like a connection, and the same
 * check applies: a second thread in a call answers ZU_MISUSE_CONCURRENT
 * rather than corrupting the columns. After finish, and after a finish
 * that failed, every call answers ZU_MISUSE_CLOSED and only
 * zu_loader_free is left.
 *

/* ---- appending ----
 *
 * How values get into a table that already exists. A statement is the
 * wrong shape for it: every row is parsed, bound, planned and
 * committed, and the commit is the expensive part, so a million rows is
 * a million commits and the load is dominated by durability work nobody
 * asked for. An appender buffers rows and pays one commit per flush.
 *
 * A row is written a value at a time, in the order the table declares
 * its columns, and ended by zu_append_end_row. A column is a position
 * rather than a name, because naming one per value would cost a lookup
 * on the one path where per-value cost is the whole story and a loader
 * knows its own column order. The columns are there to be read back:
 * zu_appender_cols is how many values a row carries and
 * zu_appender_col_name is what each one is called.
 *
 * A refused value ends the row it was in, whether the column would not
 * take it or it was no value at all. The values that row had already
 * written come back off, the error names the column and says what it
 * holds, and the next value starts a new row. A row of the wrong width
 * is refused the same way at zu_append_end_row. Nothing of a refused row
 * is kept, so an appender is still usable once the loop is fixed. A row
 * that was never ended is not a row: a flush takes it back off rather
 * than writing a short one.
 *
 * A rel table has no property columns. A row of one is the two ends of
 * an edge, as offsets into the tables it runs between, so those are its
 * two columns and they are named for what they are. A negative offset
 * is refused where it was appended, since it is no row of anything. An
 * edge to a row that is not there is refused at the flush, before
 * anything is written, and the file is left as it was.
 *
 * A flush is one commit. When it returns the rows are durable and every
 * later statement sees them, and before it returns nothing sees
 * anything. A flush with nothing buffered touches no file, so a host
 * can flush on a timer without writing empty commits, and a flush that
 * failed keeps its rows so what did not go in is still there to look
 * at. Opening the appender is where a table nothing declares, a table
 * that stores no properties, a column that holds a null and a read-only
 * connection are refused, rather than at the first flush a million rows
 * later.
 *
 * An appender is used from one thread, like the connection it writes
 * through, and it takes that connection's claim for every call: a
 * second thread in a call, or a statement running on the same
 * connection, answers ZU_MISUSE_CONCURRENT rather than tearing a
 * buffer. After close, every call but close answers ZU_MISUSE_CLOSED
 * and only zu_appender_free is left. Closing twice writes nothing the
 * second time, so a cleanup path may close what the load already did.
 *
 * zu_appender_free writes what is still buffered, because rows that
 * were appended are rows the host meant to write; what it cannot do is
 * say that the write failed, which is what close is for. A host that
 * wants the rows gone calls zu_appender_discard and gets exactly

/* ---- frames ----
 *
 * How values get queried without getting in at all. A host holding
 * columns in memory names them as a table of one connection and runs
 * statements over them where they lie. Nothing is copied, at
 * registration or at read: a scan builds vectors that point straight at
 * the host's buffers wherever the layouts agree, and widens a value at
 * a time into a scratch arena where they do not, so a host with a
 * hundred columns pays for the one the statement named and a frame of
 * ten million rows registers in the time it takes to walk its columns.
 *
 * The layouts that agree are the ones Arrow and this engine both keep:
 * 64-bit signed integers, doubles, one bit a row for a boolean, and
 * characters end to end with offsets cutting them up. A narrower
 * integer, an unsigned one, a single-precision float and a count of
 * microseconds against the nanoseconds this engine keeps time in are
 * all widened as the statement reaches them. Strings never copy their
 * characters either way: what a scan builds is the sixteen-byte view a
 * row of the string lane is, and that view points back into the host's
 * data buffer.
 *
 * The order is create, then a column call per column, then register.
 * Every column call takes the count of values it is passing and a
 * mismatch with the frame's row count is refused at that call, where
 * the caller still knows which column it was describing. Everything
 * else that can fail is settled at zu_conn_register: alignment, an
 * unsigned value too large for the signed lane, a scale that would
 * overflow, an offset that leaves its buffer. A read of a registered
 * frame cannot fail, which is what lets a scan be a loop.
 *
 * The buffers stay the host's and this library never writes one. What
 * it asks for is that each stays where it is, unwritten and unfreed,
 * until the release callback runs. That callback is how a host learns
 * the engine is finished: it runs once, on a thread of this library's,
 * after the last statement reading the frame ends, which is not the
 * unregister that preceded it and not necessarily the free either. A
 * host that has to take a lock, or a runtime's interpreter lock, to let
 * go of what it passed takes it inside the callback. Both owner and
 * release may be NULL for a host whose buffers outlive the process.
 *
 * A frame is described once and registered as often as you like. The
 * handle stays the caller's on every path, so registering it on two
 * connections registers the same memory twice, and zu_frame_free is
 * what ends it either way.
 *
 * A frame is read only and has no edges. A statement that would insert
 * into, set on or delete from a registered name is refused with 25G03
 * and the reason. A name a stored table already holds is refused;
 * a name another frame holds replaces that frame. Registering inside a
 * transaction is 25G01, since a table appearing halfway through one is
 * not a thing the transaction could then be rolled back over.
 *
